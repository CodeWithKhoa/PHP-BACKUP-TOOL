It supports exporting to **`.sql`** (database only) or **`.zip`** (database + source code), which can be **downloaded directly** or **stored automatically**.

---

## ✨ Features
- 📦 **Backup entire MySQL database**.
- 🗂 **Compress and store project folder** as `.zip`.
- ⏬ **Download backup files directly** from the browser.
- 🔒 **Protect backup folder** with `.htaccess`.

## ⏰ Automating Backups with Cron (Cron Job)
You can automate the backup process by using a **Cron Job** on your server. This allows you to schedule the backup script to run automatically at specific intervals.

Below are some examples of how to set up a cron job. You may need to adjust the URL to your script.

### Specific Time Backups
### Example 1: Daily backup at 2:00 AM
This command uses `curl` to trigger the backup script every day at 2:00 AM.
```Bash
0 2 * * * /usr/bin/curl http://yourdomain.com/PHP-BACKUP-TOOL/backup > /dev/null 2>&1
```
### Example 2: Weekly backup at 3:00 AM on Sunday
This command uses `wget` to trigger the backup script every Sunday at 3:00 AM.
``` Bash
0 3 * * 0 /usr/bin/wget -q -O /dev/null http://yourdomain.com/PHP-BACKUP-TOOL/backup
```
### Interval-Based Backups (Every 'n' hours)
You can use the `*/n` syntax to run a job at a regular interval.

### Example 3: Every 6 hours
This will run the backup at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 daily.
```Bash
0 */6 * * * /usr/bin/curl http://yourdomain.com/PHP-BACKUP-TOOL/backup/ > /dev/null 2>&1
```
### Example 4: Every hour
This will run the backup at the beginning of every hour (e.g., 1:00, 2:00, 3:00...).
```Bash
0 * * * * /usr/bin/curl http://yourdomain.com/PHP-BACKUP-TOOL/backup/ > /dev/null 2>&1
```
### Note:
* Replace http://yourdomain.com/PHP-BACKUP-TOOL/backup/ with the actual URL to your backup script.
* The > /dev/null 2>&1 part prevents cron from sending you an email every time the job runs.

## 🔐 Security
- The `backups/` folder has **`.htaccess`** to block direct access.
